        <h2>Who I Am</h2>
<!-- <article>
            <p>I am a skilled <strong>MERN Stack Developer</strong> with over 4 years of experience in designing, developing, and maintaining robust web applications. Specializing in full-stack development, I work with technologies like JavaScript, Node.js, Express, React, and MongoDB to deliver high-quality, scalable solutions. Throughout my career, I have collaborated with diverse teams, optimizing performance and enhancing user experiences by integrating the latest web technologies.</p>
            
            <p>Alongside my technical expertise, I am currently serving as a <strong>Software Engineer at Atomcamp</strong>, where I contribute to building software solutions while expanding my knowledge in <strong>Flutter development</strong> and other emerging technologies. My experience at Atomcamp has allowed me to grow both technically and professionally, working on projects that leverage cutting-edge frameworks and tools.</p>

            <p>I also have a background as a <strong>Technical Mentor</strong> at <strong>Sir Najeeb Technical Training Institutions</strong> and <strong>Government TEVTA College</strong>, where I have mentored students in modern web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and more. This experience has strengthened my leadership and communication skills, enabling me to effectively teach and guide aspiring developers in their journey.</p>

            <p>In addition to my development work, I recently took a trip to <strong>Saudi Arabia (KSA)</strong>,  <img src="images/
          sunny.jpg" alt="Shahzaib Shakeel Cheema" class="myPic">where I explored the latest tech trends and innovations. This journey allowed me to network with industry leaders and gain valuable insights into the rapidly growing tech ecosystem in the region. It was an eye-opening experience that has broadened my perspective on global tech advancements.</p>

            <p>Currently, I am also expanding into the <strong>e-commerce</strong> space, focusing on the cutlery and kitchenware market. This venture has provided me with hands-on experience in managing an online store and navigating the business side of e-commerce, alongside my technical work.</p>

            <p>With a strong technical foundation and a passion for continuous learning, I am dedicated to solving complex challenges and driving innovation in both the tech industry and business sectors.</p>
